      <h2>The Street</h2>
      <p>Itâ€™s a long and silent <strong>Street.</strong> <br>
I walk in the dark and <em>trip</em> and fall <br>
and get up and step <em>blindly </em><br>
on the mute stones and dry leaves <br>
and <strong>someone behind me is also walking:</strong> <br>
if I stop, he stops; <br>
if I run, he runs. I turn around: no one. <br>
<strong>Everything is black, there is no exit, </strong><br>
and I turn and turn <em>corners</em> <br>
that always lead to the <b>street </b><br>
where no one waits for me, no one <em>follows, </em><br>
<strong>where I follow a man who trips </strong><br>
and gets up and says when he sees me: no one</p>
