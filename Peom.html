      <h2>The Street</h2>
      <p>Itâ€™s a long and silent street. <br>
I walk in the dark and trip and fall <br>
and get up and step blindly <br>
on the mute stones and dry leaves <br>
and someone behind me is also walking: <br>
if I stop, he stops; <br>
if I run, he runs. I turn around: no one. <br>
Everything is black, there is no exit, <br>
and I turn and turn corners <br>
that always lead to the street <br>
where no one waits for me, no one follows, <br>
where I follow a man who trips <br>
and gets up and says when he sees me: no one</p>
